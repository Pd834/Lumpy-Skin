# Lumpy-Skin
Code used to classify lumpy skin disease in cow.
We used Random forest, Improved Gradient Boosting Classifier, Support vector machine.
Data Collection: 
Clinical records, laboratory test results, environmental variables, and geographic information were collected from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning, feature engineering, transformation, and integration were performed to prepare the data for analysis.
Feature Selection: 
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and feature importance ranking techniques were applied to select the most informative features.
Model Development: 
An improved Gradient Boosting Classifier was developed, enhancing traditional algorithms with optimized hyperparameters, loss functions, and ensemble techniques.
Model Evaluation: 
Cross-validation and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were used to assess the model's performance.
Model Interpretation: 
SHAP values and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) were employed to interpret feature contributions and understand the decision-making process.
Implementation and Deployment: 
The model was implemented using Python libraries and considered for deployment through various strategies.
